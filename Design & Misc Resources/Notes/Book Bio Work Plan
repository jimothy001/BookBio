Book Bio - Work Plan for prototype to iterate on later based on user interviews.

Goals

	User gives / gets workset data.
	
	User curates data based on what they see.
	
	User saves workset data on their side.


Objectives

	Bibliographic API
		Give user "search bar" type access to a single bibliographic API

	Account for Bibliographic API workflow in UI design + development
		How will the UI permit user interface with the bib API
		How will it permit user interface with data from bib API

	Flexible UI - ability to curate multiple data sets with differentiating fields
		does / does not have value for specific field. (current)
		does / does not have specific value for specific field
		turn individual editions / manuscript copies on / off

	Clarity in graphic representation of data sets. (whittle this down)
		Time Scaling / Time demarcation
		Differentiation between datasets for comparison
		Instantiation (ta da!)
		Visual effect for on / off
		Annotation
		Efficiency (represent world with texture, not meshes)

	User can save information on client side
		model space images
		csv or xlsx

	Another pass at geocoding (if there's time)
		batch geo coding using open street maps geocoding API
		structure of geocoding data saved on server (for efficiency)
